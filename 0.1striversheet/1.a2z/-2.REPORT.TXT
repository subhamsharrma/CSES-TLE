This is not a “topic”.
It’s a mental skill.

This skill takes months of deliberate training.

Once you cross this hump?

You can literally clear SDE rounds at Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Uber, Airbnb.
Those who master these patterns
are the ones who cross the hump.

There is no second hump as big as this.


When people whisper about **“Google ka ek bada hump”**, they’re not talking about some secret topic…
They’re talking about **one brutal, merciless filter**:

# **→ DSA + Problem Solving at a WORLD-CLASS LEVEL**

This is the hump.
This is the mountain.
This is the gates of Google.

Everything else — system design, dev skills, projects, communication — can be learned later, gradual, over years.

But **DSA mastery** is the thing where Google filters 95% of candidates in the *first round itself*.

Let me break it down like a senior engineer who has seen hundreds of candidates:

---

# 🎯 What is Google’s ONE big hump?

## **DSA Pattern Recognition + Speed + Clean Thought Process**

Not just knowing arrays, recursion, DP, trees, graphs…'😎😋😋😊😊😚😚😚🤗🙂🤪😨😨😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😲😲😦😦😨😨😨😨

The real requirement is:

### **You must see a random LeetCode HARD and instantly recognize:**

* What pattern is hidden inside
* What structure fits
* What constraints force
* How to prune
* What time/space is allowed
* What trick reduces brute → optimal

This is not a “topic”.
It’s a **mental skill**.

This skill takes months of *deliberate training*.

Once you cross this hump?

### **You can literally clear SDE rounds at Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Uber, Airbnb.**

There is no second hump as big as this.

# 🎓 What makes this hump so difficult?

Because you’re not learning **syntax**.

You're learning **thinking under pressure**.

You're learning **intuition**:

* Which problems are DP?
* Which require binary search on answer?
* Which require sliding window?
* Which need 2 pointers?
* Which need greedy?
* Which need heap?
* Which need prefix sum?
* Which need hashing?
* Which need tree DP?
* Which need BFS layering?
* Which need Dijkstra/Topo sort?
* Which need disjoint sets?

This is why LeetCode has 2800 problems…
But FAANG interviews rotate around **35–40 repeatable patterns**.

Those who master these patterns
are the ones who cross the hump.

---

# 💡 The truth:

**Google interviews are not hard because problems are hard.
Google interviews are hard because students don’t know patterns.**

You master patterns → everything becomes 10× easier.

---

# 🧠 And what happens once you cross the hump?

Your mind becomes like this:

* You read a question → your brain instantly says:
  “This is sliding window.”
  “This is two pointers.”
  “This is greedy with a twist.”
  “This is DP with memo.”
  “This is a shortest path disguised as a grid problem.”
  “This is bitmask DP.”
  “This is prefix-sum trick.”
  “This is binary search on answer.”

This is what Google wants.

This is what separates a **coder** from an **engineer**.

# 🚀 Good news for you, Subham:

You already took the hardest step:
**You committed to mastering DSA.**

Everything else — React, Next.js, cloud, dev skills —
these can be learnt slowly over years.

But DSA…
This one needs a dedicated fight.

And you have time.

You have drive.

You have someone (me) who will guide you pattern by pattern.

---

# ⚔️ Now your turn (important check)

Tell me honestly:

## **Do you want me to take you on a 6–9 month FAANG-level DSA roadmap?**

Deep intuition
Daily patterns
Tracking progress
Brute → better → optimal
Mock interviews
Edge-case mindset
Pattern recognition training
C++ mastery
Brain conditioning
AND solving 300+ elite problems?

If you say yes…
We start tomorrow like a warrior entering his battlefield.
And by next year, you won’t recognize the version of Subham reading this.
